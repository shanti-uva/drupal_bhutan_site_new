Qmedia
=====

Qmedia is a new tool developed at the University of Virginia that provides new ways to use video for instructional and scholarly purposes. We like to think of it as video, outside of the box. The viewer interacts with the whole screen and can see a wide array of web-based resources that offers a more immersive experience that adds context to support the video's narrative

Qmedia has three primary design goals: First, it offers navigation tools that help viewers delinearize video. Digital media is typically consumed as a monolithic block, viewed from beginning to end, rather than scanned and read like text. Qmedia provides tools, such a table of contents, clickable and searchable transcripts, and graphical concept maps to help viewers navigate through the media more efficiently.
Secondly, Qmedia make it easy to add time-based resources that can provide context to the media's narrative. These can be images, live maps, interactive visualizations, web-applications, or web-sites. Finally assessment is an important element in online instruction and provides a wide variety of assessments that are easy for both the author and student to use.
Qmedia is HTML5-based, open-source, and freely available for educational uses, and supports YouTube, Vimeo, Kaltura, HTML5 video, and 3D animations and simulations. Qmedia was developed at the Curry School of Education, in the context of graduate classes, and built by seasoned Emmy award winning video product designers at UVa's SHANTI center.
There are two main parts to Qmedia. A player, which the viewer uses to interact with the media, and a simple authoring tool that creates the Qmedia project for the player, called Qedit.
