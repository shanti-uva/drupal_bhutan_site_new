Why is this module needed?

There is a requirement that an administrator of a collection, say THL Collection, 
be able to view, edit and delete content from Teams that fall under a collection.

But, we can't simply make Team content automagically be Collection content as well because then 
Collection visibility settings would be able to override Team visibility settings for nodes that are set 
to "Use group defaults" for their visibility.

A Mediabase audio or video node can only belong to one organic group ( either  a collection, or a team).

So how do we see team content then in the Collection view?

In the collection views, we alter the views query (in mb_structure_views_query_alter) that lists 
media for a collection to also grab media from teams
