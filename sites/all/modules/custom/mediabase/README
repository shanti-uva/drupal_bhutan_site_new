There is an install script you can run from your webroot that builds a mediabase instance in a directory called drupal_mediabase.

The install script does the following:
1. download a set of modules and themes from drupal.org (using drush make and the mediabase.make make file
2. checks out the mediabase git repository and submodules from github
3. Does a site install which creates the database and creates a settings.php in sites/mediabase. NOTE: Edit the install file to add your own database credentials and desired drupal username/password
4. Installs three Features (features module)

Once the site is installed, login at <mediabase_root>/user. 
mediabase_root should be http://yourserver.com/drupal_mediabase/. You may need to edit sites.php to tell drupal that the supdirectory, 'drupal_mediabase', points to the sites/mediabase directory.

SITE CONFIGURATIONS

BASIC
Create a home page with a blurb at: <mediabase_root>/node/add/page
Set that page as the site front page here: <mediabase_root>/admin/config/system/site-information

KALTURA
<mediabase_root>/admin/config/media/kaltura

MEDIABASE
<mediabase_root>/admin/config/media/mediabase - here, you set a key-value pair for partner data prefixes to urls to be used in the pbcore identifier field. for example for thl|thlib.org.  In the kaltura bulk upload csv, partner data was set to thl-5032 (to correspond to old id 5032)

<mediabase_root>/admin/content/mediabase/import?filter=<partner-data-prefix>

<mediabase_root>/admin/structure/types/manage/video/fields/field_video  
    Set the Content Ingestion to "Use Existing Only"
    Set the Media Player to Mediabase Video Player

<mediabase_root>/admin/structure/types/manage/audio/fields/field_audio  
    Set the Content Ingestion to "Use Existing Only"
    Set the Media Player to Mediabase Audio Player

TRANSCRIPTS
<mediabase_root>/admin/config/search/apachesolr/transcripts
<mediabase_root>/admin/config/search/apachesolr/settings

ORGANIC GROUPS
<mediabase_root>/admin/config/group/permissions
Set default group permissions (In the future, og will get features integration but for now we must re-configure; see http://drupal.org/node/1349754)

LOGO
This is set in the mb_html5 theme's css/global.css. This should probably be changed to work with the standard drupal site logo.
